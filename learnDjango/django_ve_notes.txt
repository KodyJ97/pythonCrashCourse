Create Virtual Environment named ll_env
python3 -m venv ll_env

Activate the Virtual Environment
source ll_env/bin/activate
$ -> (ll_env) should appear left of working directory

Install Django
pip3 install Django

Create a Project in Django
django-admin.py startproject learning_log .
Do not forget the dot at end of there may be some config issues

Create Database
python3 manage.py migrate

Viewing the project
python3 manage.py runserver
Check localhost:8000 or on specified port number.

If port is already in use we can tell Django to use another port (cycle thru higher #'s)
python3 manage.py runserver 8001

Tell Django to modify the database so it can store new info related to new apps in settings?
python manage.py makemigrations learning_logs

Now apply migration and have Django modify the database for us
$ python manage.py migrate

How to create a superuser
python3 manage.py createsuperuser

Django Shell Stuff
python3 manage.py shell

Some Django Shell Commands
from learning_logs.models import Topic - First we import the model topic
Topic.objects.all() - get all instances off the model topic - queryset

or

topics = Topic.objects.all()
for topic in topics:
	print(topic.id, topic)

t = Topic.objects.get(id=1)
>>> t.text
'Chess'
>>> t.date_added
datetime.datetime(2015, 5, 28, 4, 39, 11, 989446, tzinfo=<UTC>)

To get data through a foreign key relationship, you use the lowercase name of the related model followed by an underscore and the word set . For example, say you have the models Pizza and Topping, and Topping is related to Pizza through a foreign key. If your object is called my_pizza, representing a single pizza, you can get all of the pizzaâ€™s toppings using the code my_pizza.topping_set.all().

Adding new apps.
Create .py file in learning logs
then create a new url for it
then add it to the view
last create the html template for it (extends base)
